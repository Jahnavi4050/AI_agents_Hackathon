## 📚 Why Study Internet Outages?

### The Cost of Downtime
Internet outages don't just inconvenience users—they have real economic and societal impacts:
- **Financial Losses**: Major outages can cost companies millions per hour
- **Emergency Services**: Disrupted communication affects first responders and healthcare
- **Economic Impact**: Global outages can reduce GDP and affect international trade
- **Trust Erosion**: Repeated failures damage user confidence in digital services

### Learning from Failure
This archive demonstrates that:
- **Prevention is Possible**: Most outages result from preventable configuration errors
- **Patterns Exist**: Similar failure modes repeat across different services
- **Innovation Drives Resilience**: Each incident leads to better monitoring and recovery systems
- **Transparency Matters**: Open analysis helps the entire industry improve

### Building Better Systems
By studying these incidents, engineers and organizations can:
- Implement more robust monitoring and alerting
- Design systems with better fault tolerance
- Develop comprehensive incident response plans
- Foster a culture of learning from failures rather than blame
