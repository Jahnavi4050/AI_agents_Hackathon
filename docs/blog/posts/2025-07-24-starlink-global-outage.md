# Starlink Global Outage

# Starlink Global Outage

## Summary
On July 24, 2025, SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service experienced a global outage affecting millions of users worldwide, caused by a software update that disrupted satellite communications.

## Timeline
- **July 24, 2025, 06:00 UTC**: Automated software update begins deployment to satellites.
- **06:30 UTC**: Initial reports of connectivity issues.
- **07:00 UTC**: Widespread outage confirmed globally.
- **08:00 UTC**: SpaceX acknowledges the issue.
- **09:00 UTC**: Investigation reveals software bug in update.
- **10:00 UTC**: Rollback procedure initiated.
- **12:00 UTC**: Partial restoration begins.
- **15:00 UTC**: Full service restored.

## Root Cause
A software bug in the satellite firmware update caused satellites to enter an error state, preventing proper communication with ground stations. The update was deployed without sufficient testing in the orbital environment.

## Impact
- Complete loss of internet connectivity for Starlink users worldwide.
- Disruption of critical services in remote areas dependent on Starlink.
- Emergency services and remote work affected in underserved regions.
- Significant impact on maritime and aviation communications.

## Resolution
- Emergency software rollback to previous stable version.
- Implementation of more rigorous testing protocols for satellite updates.
- Enhanced monitoring of satellite health and communication status.

## Lessons Learned
- Thorough testing of software updates in simulated orbital conditions.
- Gradual deployment strategies for critical satellite infrastructure.
- Improved redundancy in satellite-to-ground communication systems.
